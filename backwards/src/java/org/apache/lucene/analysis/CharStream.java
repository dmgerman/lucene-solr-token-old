comment|/**  * CharStream adds {@link #correctOffset}  * functionality over {@link Reader}.  All Tokenizers accept a  * CharStream instead of {@link Reader} as input, which enables  * arbitrary character based filtering before tokenization.   * The {@link #correctOffset} method fixed offsets to account for  * removal or insertion of characters, so that the offsets  * reported in the tokens match the character offsets of the  * original Reader.  */
