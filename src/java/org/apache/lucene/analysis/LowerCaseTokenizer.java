comment|/** LowerCaseTokenizer performs the function of LetterTokenizer   and LowerCaseFilter together.  It divides text at non-letters and converts   them to lower case.  While it is functionally equivalent to the combination   of LetterTokenizer and LowerCaseFilter, there is a performance advantage   to doing the two tasks at once, hence this (redundent) implementation.    Note: this does a decent job for most European languages, but does a terrible   job for some Asian languages, where words are not separated by spaces. */
