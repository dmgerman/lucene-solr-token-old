comment|/** Expert: Calculate query weights and build query scorers.  *<p>  * The purpose of Weight is to make it so that searching does not modify  * a Query, so that a Query instance can be reused.<br>  * Searcher dependent state of the query should reside in the Weight.<br>  * IndexReader dependent state should reside in the Scorer.  *<p>  * A<code>Weight</code> is used in the following way:  *<ol>  *<li>A<code>Weight</code> is constructed by a top-level query,  *     given a<code>Searcher</code> ({@link Query#createWeight(Searcher)}).  *<li>The {@link #sumOfSquaredWeights()} method is called  *     on the<code>Weight</code> to compute  *     the query normalization factor {@link Similarity#queryNorm(float)}  *     of the query clauses contained in the query.  *<li>The query normalization factor is passed to {@link #normalize(float)}.  *     At this point the weighting is complete.  *<li>A<code>Scorer</code> is constructed by {@link #scorer(IndexReader)}.  *</ol>  *   * @deprecated use {@link QueryWeight} instead.   */
