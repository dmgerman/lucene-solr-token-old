$id: $

* Bugs
	- on very fast LAN connections (100MBit), sockets are not freed as fast as allocated
	- some relative URLs are not appended appropriately, leading to wrong and growing URLs

* Build
	- added build.xml, but build.bat and build.sh are still working without ANT. Change that.

* LuceneStorage
	- define a configurable interface that saves fetched pages into a Lucene index

* Configuration
	- move all configuration stuff into a meaningful properties file

* URLs: 
	- include a URLNormalizer
	  * lowercase host names
	  * avoid ambiguities like '%20' / '+'
	  * make sure http://host URLs end with "/"
	  * avoid host name aliases
	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to the same web site: www.lmu.de / www.uni-muenchen.de
	    - two host names / one ip adress can point to different web sites (then other URLs / pages must differ)
	      suche.lmu.de / interesse.lmu.de
	  * cater 301/302 result codes

* Repository
	- optionally use a database as repository (caches, queues, logs)
	- if done so, use URL reordering to speed things up

* Tests
	  - Put all tests into a JUnit test suite

* distribution
	- optionally send messages through a JMS topic. 
	- create an executable that installs a source (like JMS, page files) and a storage pipeline
	- partition the URL space for distributed Fetchers

* Speed
	- avoid synchronization delays by putting several URLMessages into one FetcherTask

* Services
	- clean up ThreadMonitor
	- incorporate a CRON-like service that enables timed GC'ing, batched data transfer, and
	  monitoring

* Politeness
	- add the option to restrict the number of host accesses per hour/minute

* Anchor text extraction
	  * read until a meaningful end tag, not just the first encountered
	  * remove entities
	  * optionally remove Tags, leave ALT attribute
	  * remove redundant spaces



Nice-to-have:

* Stop and Continue (probably with database repository)
* "Hot Configure" from outside
* Web Interface

Next topic:
* Incremental crawling
