lucli (pronounced Luckily) is the Lucene Command Line Interface.

INSTALLATION

Edit the run.sh shell script
	Edit JAVA_HOME to point to your java directory.
	Edit LUCLI to point to where you installed lucli.
	Edit LUCLI_MEMORY and set it to the maximum amount of memory you want to allocate to lucli
	You can also replace the Lucene jar file that came with lucli with your own.


ENABLING READLINE

If you add the -r command line parameter lucli will try to use a shared library 
to enable things like tab completion and history. Unfortunately Java doesn't support 
this capability natively so you'll need a shared library for this. I'm including one
that worked for me with Debian Linux.
For more details about GNU readline and java see http://java-readline.sourceforge.net/
which is the library that lucli uses.


Documentation

There is none :-). Type help at the command line or read the code.

Enjoy
