<section name="Lucene Sandbox">
<p>
Lucene project also contains a workspace, Lucene Sandbox, that is open to all Lucene committers, as well
as a few other developers.  The purpose of the Sandbox is to host various third party contributions,
and to serve as a place to try out new ideas and prepare them for inclusion into the core Lucene
distribution.<br/>
Users are free to experiment with the components developed in the Sandbox, but Sandbox components will
not necessarily be maintained, particularly in their current state.
