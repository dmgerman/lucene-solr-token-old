Bug fixes

 1. LUCENE-1423: InstantiatedTermEnum#skipTo(Term) throws ArrayIndexOutOfBounds on empty index.
    (Karl Wettin) 

 2. LUCENE-1462: InstantiatedIndexWriter did not reset pre analyzed TokenStreams the
    same way IndexWriter does. Parts of InstantiatedIndex was not Serializable.
    (Karl Wettin)

 3. LUCENE-1510: InstantiatedIndexReader#norms methods throws NullPointerException on empty index.
    (Karl Wettin, Robert Newson)

 4. LUCENE-1514: ShingleMatrixFilter#next(Token) easily throws a StackOverflowException
    due to recursive invocation. (Karl Wettin)

 5. LUCENE-1548: Fix distance normalization in LevenshteinDistance to
    not produce negative distances (Thomas Morton via Mike McCandless)

 6. LUCENE-1490: Fix latin1 conversion of HALFWIDTH_AND_FULLWIDTH_FORMS
    characters to only apply to the correct subset (Daniel Cheng via
    Mike McCandless)

 7. LUCENE-1576: Fix BrazilianAnalyzer to downcase tokens after
    StandardTokenizer so that stop words with mixed case are filtered
    out.  (Rafael Cunha de Almeida, Douglas Campos via Mike McCandless)

New features

 1. LUCENE-1470: Added TrieRangeQuery, a much faster implementation of
    RangeQuery at the expense of added space (additional indexed
    tokens) consumed in the index.  (Uwe Schindler via Mike McCandless)

 2. LUCENE-1531: Added support for BoostingTermQuery to XML query parser. (Karl Wettin)

 3. LUCENE-1435: Added contrib/collation, a CollationKeyFilter
    allowing you to convert tokens into CollationKeys encoded usign
    IndexableBinaryStringTools.  This allows for faster RangQuery when
    a field needs to use a custom Collator.  (Steven Rowe via Mike
    McCandless)

    might not be compatible with these updated classes as some algorithms have changed.
    (Karl Wettin)

 3. LUCENE-1016: TermVectorAccessor, transparent vector space access via stored vectors
    or by resolving the inverted index. (Karl Wettin)
