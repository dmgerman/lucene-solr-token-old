<h2>Apache Lucene Flexible Query Parser</h2>

<p>
This contrib project contains the new Lucene query parser implementation, which is going to replace the old query parser on Lucene 3.0. 
</p>

<p>
It's currently divided in 3 main packages:
<ul>
<li>{@link org.apache.lucene.messages}: it contains the API to defined lazily loaded messages. This message API is used by the new query parser to support localized messages.</li>
<li>{@link org.apache.lucene.queryParser.core}: it contains the query parser API classes, which should be extended by query parser implementations. </li>
<li>{@link org.apache.lucene.queryParser.standard}: it contains the current Lucene query parser implementation using the new query parser API.</li>
</ul>
</p>
