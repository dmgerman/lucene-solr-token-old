$Id$

New Features
 1. added support for setting Lucene's positionIncrementGap
 2. Admin: new statistics for SolrIndexSearcher
 3. Admin: caches now show config params on stats page
 3. max() function added to FunctionQuery suite 
 4. postOptimize hook, mirroring the functionallity of the postCommit hook,
    but only called on an index optimize.
 5. Ability to HTTP POST query requests to /select in addition to HTTP-GET
 6. The default search field may now be overridden by requests to the
    standard request handler using the df query parameter. (Erik Hatcher)
 7. Added DisMaxRequestHandler and SolrPluginUtils. (Chris Hostetter)
 8. Support for customizing the QueryResponseWriter per request
    (Mike Baranczak / SOLR-16 / hossman)
 9. Added KeywordTokenizerFactory (hossman)
10. copyField accepts dynamicfield-like names as the source.
    (Darren Erik Vengroff via yonik, SOLR-21)
     
Changes in runtime behavior
 1. classes reorganized into different packages, package names changed to Apache
 2. force read of document stored fields in QuerySenderListener
 3. Solr now looks in ./solr/conf for config, ./solr/data for data
    configurable via solr.solr.home system property

Optimizations 
 1. getDocListAndSet can now generate both a DocList and a DocSet from a 
    single lucene query.
 2. BitDocSet.intersectionSize(HashDocSet) no longer generates an intermediate
    set
 3. OpenBitSet completed, replaces BitSet as the implementation for BitDocSet.
    Iteration is faster, and BitDocSet.intersectionSize(BitDocSet) and unionSize
    is between 3 and 4 times faster. (yonik, SOLR-15)
 4. much faster unionSize when one of the sets is a HashDocSet: O(smaller_set_size)

Bug Fixes
 1. Fixed delete-by-id for field types who's indexed form is different
    from the printable form (mainly sortable numeric types).
 2. Added escaping of attribute values in the XML response (Erik Hatcher)
 3. Added empty extractTerms() to FunctionQuery to enable use in
    a MultiSearcher (Yonik)
