comment|/**  * Encodes integers to a set {@link OutputStream}. Extending classes need to  * override {@link #encode(int)} to encode the value using their encoding  * algorithm. The default implementation of {@link #close()} closes the set  * {@link OutputStream}.  *<p>  * The default {@link #IntEncoder() constructor} is provided for convenience  * only. One must call {@link #reInit(OutputStream)} before calling  * {@link #encode(int)} or {@link #close()}.  *<p>  * For convenience, each encoder implements {@link #createMatchingDecoder()} for  * easy access to the matching decoder.  *<p>  *<b>NOTE:</b> some implementations may buffer the encoded values in memory  * (such as {@link IntEncoderFilter} implementations) and encoding will happen  * only upon calling {@link #close()}. Therefore it is important to always call  * {@link #close()} on the encoder at hand.  *<p>  *<b>NOTE:</b> encoders are usually not thread safe, unless specifically  * documented otherwise by an implementation.  *   * @lucene.experimental  */
