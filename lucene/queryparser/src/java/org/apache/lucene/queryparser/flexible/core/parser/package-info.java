comment|/**   * Necessary interfaces to implement text parsers.  *   *<h2>Parser</h2>  *<p>  * The package<tt>org.apache.lucene.queryparser.flexible.parser</tt> contains interfaces  * that should be implemented by the parsers.  *   * Parsers produce QueryNode Trees from a string object.  * These package still needs some work to add support to for multiple parsers.  *   * Features that should be supported for the future, related with the parser:  * - QueryNode tree should be able convertible to any parser syntax.  * - The query syntax should support calling other parsers.  * - QueryNode tree created by multiple parsers.  */
