Classes implementing this interface can be used as a RMI -  * "remote object".  *<p>  * {@link RMIRemoteSearchable} extends {@link org.apache.lucene.search.Searchable} and can transparently  * be used as a such.  *<p>  * Example usage:  *   *<pre>  *   RMIRemoteSearchable remoteObject = ...;  *   String remoteObjectName = ...;  *   Naming.rebind (remoteObjectName, remoteObject);  *   Searchable luceneSearchable = (Searchable) Naming.lookup (remoteObjectName);  *</pre>  *   *</p>  *</p>  */
