Note, it is likely that the provided reader info does not    *         represent the whole underlying index i.e. if the index has more than    *         one segment the given reader only represents a single segment.    *         The provided context is always an atomic context, so you can call     *         {@link org.apache.lucene.index.LeafReader#fields()}    *         on the context's reader, for example.    *    * @param acceptDocs    *          Bits that represent the allowable docs to match (typically deleted docs    *          but possibly filtering other documents)    *              * @return a DocIdSet that provides the documents which should be permitted or    *         prohibited in search results.<b>NOTE:</b><code>null</code> should be returned if    *         the filter doesn't accept any documents otherwise internal optimization might not apply    *         in the case an<i>empty</i> {@link DocIdSet} is returned.    */
