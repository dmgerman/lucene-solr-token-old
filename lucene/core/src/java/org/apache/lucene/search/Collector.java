comment|/**  *<p>Expert: Collectors are primarily meant to be used to  * gather raw results from a search, and implement sorting  * or custom result filtering, collation, etc.</p>  *  *<p>Lucene's core collectors are derived from {@link Collector}  * and {@link SimpleCollector}. Likely your application can  * use one of these classes, or subclass {@link TopDocsCollector},  * instead of implementing Collector directly:  *  *<ul>  *  *<li>{@link TopDocsCollector} is an abstract base class  *   that assumes you will retrieve the top N docs,  *   according to some criteria, after collection is  *   done.</li>  *  *<li>{@link TopScoreDocCollector} is a concrete subclass  *   {@link TopDocsCollector} and sorts according to score +  *   docID.  This is used internally by the {@link  *   IndexSearcher} search methods that do not take an  *   explicit {@link Sort}. It is likely the most frequently  *   used collector.</li>  *  *<li>{@link TopFieldCollector} subclasses {@link  *   TopDocsCollector} and sorts according to a specified  *   {@link Sort} object (sort by field).  This is used  *   internally by the {@link IndexSearcher} search methods  *   that take an explicit {@link Sort}.  *  *<li>{@link TimeLimitingCollector}, which wraps any other  *   Collector and aborts the search if it's taken too much  *   time.</li>  *  *<li>{@link PositiveScoresOnlyCollector} wraps any other  *   Collector and prevents collection of hits whose score  *   is&lt;= 0.0</li>  *  *</ul>  *  * @lucene.experimental  */
