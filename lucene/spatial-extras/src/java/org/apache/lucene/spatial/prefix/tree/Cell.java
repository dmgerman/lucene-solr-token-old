To get an instance, you could start with {@link SpatialPrefixTree#getWorldCell()}.  * And from there you could either traverse down the tree with {@link #getNextLevelCells(org.locationtech.spatial4j.shape.Shape)},  * or you could read an indexed term via {@link SpatialPrefixTree#readCell(org.apache.lucene.util.BytesRef,Cell)}.  * When a cell is read from a term, it is comprised of just the base bytes plus optionally a leaf flag.  *  * @lucene.experimental  */
